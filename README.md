Fencing is supposed to be reaction speed based, but this game is a turn based fencing game? An interesting concept indeed...

Objective:
First one to get to 5 points wins

Rules:
Input a number for the move you want to make, you can use a maximum of 6 actions per turn, any extra action spent this turn that exceeds 6 actions will take up spaces in the next turn
If a player gets pushed off the piste, or leaves the piste on their own, the opponent will gain a point, and the starting position will shift forward favoring the opponent
If two players attack and land hits at the same time, then whoever charged up an attack more will gain a point (fakes count as charging attacks). If both players have the same charge, both gain points
Refer to moves and icons for more information

Pve:
Play with a bot

Pvp:
Play with a player, because there isn't a socket implementation yet, to play pvp, there must be a host, then stream on discord, while the 2 players dm the host the moves
